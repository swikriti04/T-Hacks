Problem Statement:
We being a curious student always wanted to learn practically as much as we can, we wanted to do experiments other than which are in our manual, but are we allowed to do that, absolutely no. Taking the factors in account that 
•	How institutes kill the curiosity of children by not allowing them to do practical experiments in schools.
•	Professionals who have extreme workplaces don’t have safe place to practice.
•	Lots of money and maintenance goes into purchasing and retaining expensive lab equipment.
•	Can’t access labs remotely.

Our Solution:
•	We are going to create a virtual platform that anyone can access at any time and can be practically applied in any field.
•	A virtual self-laboratory where we can do any experiment we want.
•	It will help children to have hands on practical learning.
Points to consider:
•	We are trying to make it accessible for most of the fields like chemistry, physics, electronics and even bomb diffusion training.
•	It will be accessible 24/7 and remotely which is in great need in this COVID-19 outbreak.

Feasibility:
•	According to a study done by Goldman Sachs just last year, they estimated that the VR market will be worth about 20.46 Billion $.
•	There is a great need for such technology all around the world, for example in schools all around the country it is very common for students to finish their entire lower studies all the way up to 12th without ever entering a lab or doing a single experiment.
